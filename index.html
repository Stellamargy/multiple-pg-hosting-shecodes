    <h1>Mt.Kenya</h1>
    <p>Mount Kenya is an extinct stratovolcano in Kenya and the second-highest peak in Africa, after Kilimanjaro. The highest peaks of the mountain are Batian, Nelion and Point Lenana.</p>
    <p>Mount Kenya (Kikuyu: Kĩrĩnyaga, Kamba, Ki Nyaa, Embu, Kirenyaa) is an extinct stratovolcano in Kenya and the second-highest peak in Africa, after Kilimanjaro.[5] The highest peaks of the mountain are Batian (5,199 metres or 17,057 feet), Nelion (5,188 m or 17,021 ft) and Point Lenana (4,985 m or 16,355 ft). Mount Kenya is located in the former Eastern and Central provinces of Kenya; its peak is now the intersection of Meru, Embu, Kirinyaga, Nyeri and Tharaka Nithi counties, about 16.5 kilometres (10.3 miles) south of the equator, around 150 km (90 mi) north-northeast of the capital Nairobi.[6][5] Mount Kenya is the source of the name of the Republic of Kenya.</p>
    <p>Mount Kenya is a volcano created approximately 3 million years after the opening of the East African Rift.[7] Before glaciation, it was 7,000 m (23,000 ft) high. It was covered by an ice cap for thousands of years. This has resulted in very eroded slopes and numerous valleys radiating from the peak.[8][9] There are currently 11 small glaciers, which are shrinking rapidly, and may disappear by 2050.[10] The forested slopes are an important source of water for much of Kenya.</p>
